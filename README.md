# Football match XG Data Scrapping and visualizing.

In this project we are scraping football match data from understat website https://understat.com/

In this website each match is represented by a particular match-id,using that match_id we are scrapping the contents using beautiful soup and requests.

After scraping data we are converting the data into a dictionary

The dictionary is converted into dataframe and the dataframe is saved into .csv file.

The csv file is uploaded into tableau and dashboard for each team XG is created
